// network calls — those have their own offline handling (Firestore's
// built-in IndexedDB persistence, and the custom photo-upload queue in
// kytrac-app.js). Layering a generic cache-first strategy on top of
// those would fight their retry/sync logic, so this worker only ever
// intercepts same-origin static assets.
